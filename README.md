SoulVerse

SoulVerse is a minimalist Chrome new tab extension that offers daily inspiration from the Bible. It integrates the Ethiopian calendar date in Amharic and displays calm spiritual backgrounds to create a peaceful and reflective browsing experience.



Overview

Each time you open a new browser tab, SoulVerse presents:
- A Bible story drawn from a locally stored JSON file.
- The current Ethiopian calendar date in Amharic.
- A clean interface with warm, rotating background images.
- Quick-access icons for frequently used websites such as Google, Gmail, ChatGPT, and YouTube.

The extension refreshes twice a day—morning and afternoon—to display a new story and provide users with a calm and thoughtful start to their browsing experience.

In future versions, the system will:
- Automatically fetch new stories or verses from a live Bible API.
- Update content daily without manual changes.
- Integrate AI-generated background imagery based on the story theme.
